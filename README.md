Summary:

The Regents, in an attempt to make financial gam, duped a distinguished and well-respected professor into providing the course materials that he had prepared following his retirement and that The Regents knew he intended to be a source of income during his retirement. Then, when plaintiff began to criticize The Regents and its business partner and in order to hide their misconduct, they began a defamatory campaign and summarily drummed the professor out of his teaching position by severely criticizing his competency and painting a false picture concerning his disengagement from the course. The Regents have since admitted it breached a duty to protect the professor's intellectual rights. As a result of the Defendants' actions, the professor sustained irreparable damage to his reputation, both professionally and personally, as well as significant economic damage due to the loss of his intellectual property rights. 

Comment:

The case was for $230,000, in lost intellectual property. It also looks like the complainant is attempting to establish officially that there was a co-conspiracy leading to a defamatory campaign against him. 



The case was filed 02/03/2014, and ended 04/29/2014.
