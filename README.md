This is the case 

**Richard McKenzie** (Prof Emeritus Economics UC Irvine)

vs 

**Coursera Inc**, 

**Daphne Koller** (President Coursera), 

**Gary Matkin** (Dean of Education UC Irvine), 

**The Regents of The University of California**,

**Does** (unknowns to be clarified later). 

He is suing Koller, Matkin and the Does both in their official and individual capacity.

The file *pacer.html* offers a summary, essentially only useful for the timing information (reproduced below anyways).
The case was filed at the Central District of California, for $230,000, case#: 8:14-cv-00149-JVS-JPR
The case was entered 02/03/2014 (approximately a year after the course itself), and ended 04/29/2014 by the complainant, "with prejudice". Most likely this means a settlement was reached. 

Summary
=======

This taken from the original filing, *McKenzie1.pdf*. The other files are almost exclusively procedural. 

> The Regents, in an attempt to make financial gain, duped a distinguished and well-respected professor into providing the course materials that he had prepared following his retirement and that The Regents knew he intended to be a source of income during his retirement. Then, when plaintiff began to criticize The Regents and its business partner and in order to hide their misconduct, they began a defamatory campaign and summarily drummed the professor out of his teaching position by severely criticizing his competency and painting a false picture concerning his disengagement from the course. The Regents have since admitted it breached a duty to protect the professor's intellectual rights. As a result of the Defendants' actions, the professor sustained irreparable damage to his reputation, both professionally and personally, as well as significant economic damage due to the loss of his intellectual property rights. 

Comments
========

The following is meant to provide a quick comment on the complaint, and a comparison with the author's personal experience with Coursera's tactics in a relatively similar situation. 

The case was for $230,000, in lost intellectual property. The complainant was promised the videos he had personally produced would only be available for streaming, but were actually directly downloadable, downloaded 230,000 times, and are now on YouTube. The initial filing includes a copy of an internal whistleblower complaint filed by McKenzie with the UC Irvine. The related investigation took around 7 months, which explains the lengthy delay between the end of the course and the filing of the court complaint. The response, coming from the Associate Executive Vice Chancellor, states that:

> The University's investigator has determined that Dean Matkin, in his capacity as Dean of Continuing Education, failed to have safeguards in place that would protect the intellectual property rights of Professor McKenzie prior to the release of his course on the Coursera platform. 

This confirms McKenzie's filing concerning the lost intellectual property, and what probably led quickly to a settlement.

Much of this court complaint is actually disjoint from the issue of the videos, and touches on issues surrounding the textbook and the public communication concerning the course. 

The textbook associated to the course was also written by McKenzie. According to him, he was upfront with Coursera and his administration that he intended to teach based on that textbook, made available for free to the students, with the hope of selling copies for personal profit. Coursera's contracts with UC Irvine, which McKenzie had not seen (and eventually costed him the videos), made it impossible for Cambridge University Press to accept that arrangement. This left McKenzie with a large handicap when the course actually started.

**More inflammatory**, McKenzie alleges that there was a conspiracy leading to a defamation campaign against him. This certainly matches [the public record](http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professor-leaves-a-mooc-in-mid-course-in-dispute-over-teaching/42381), as the allegations are very different publicly and in court. In the complainant's words, *In academia, reputation means everything*, and the complaint reads like an attempt to correct the record. He is not asking for monetary compensation for this alleged campaign. 

According to him, Koller met Matkin and others at a dinner, where she made false accusations against him. He claims some of his comments on academic standards were distorted. He alleges the accusations were meant to force Irvine to terminate McKenzie's involvement with the course. This apparently worked. Quoting from the complaint:

> - 61. On February 6,2013, Matkin repeated Koller's false statements when he publically denounced McKenzie during a coffee with several colleagues. During the discussion, Matkin told the attendees that McKenzie "was an embarrassment to the University and [McKenzie's] conduct related to The Course threatened the reputation of the University ... When she [Koller] began to read what [McKenzie] had written to [his] students, I was never more embarrassed personally and for the University in my career."
> - 62. These statements were false and caused - and will continue to cause - irreparable harm to McKenzie's reputation.
> - 63. For a University that has endured multiple noteworthy scandals -- fertility, Willed Body Program, Liver Transplant Program, falsification of records by anesthesiologist, the hiring-firing-rehiring of its founding law school dean, and a  $1,200,000.00 settlement related to a federal whistleblower lawsuit -- this was an astonishingly devastating - and unfounded -- public ridicule of an esteemed member of the University community.
> - 64. Matkin made his statements during the coffee without checking the quality of The Course McKenzie developed, McKenzie's management of The Course, or the context in which the purportedly offensive statements were made. 

This was meant to intimidate McKenzie into dropping off of the course:

> - 67. During the coffee, Matkin offered McKenzie a buyout to disengage after only two weeks of The Course. The buyout was meant to effectively silence Mckenzie on his criticisms of the MOOC concept and conflicts he had had with Coursera and The Regents concerning The Course (see below).
> - 68. Given the bullying and strong-arm tactics that began at the coffee, McKenzie felt he had no option but to capitulate to Defendants' wishes and disengage from The Course. 

This was followed by a public campaign totally at odds with the real situation, showing a clear lack of support to its professor by the university:

> - 69. Thereafter, Defendants cast additional false light upon McKenzie by making untruthful media accounts. These are additional assaults on his reputation.
> - 70. Koller and Matkin falsely advised the media that McKenzie voluntarily disengaged from The Course.
> - 71. Matkin effectively told everyone who asked - including the media - that McKenzie's disengagement was autonomous and had nothing to do with Matkin.
> - 72. Similarly, when reporters called for Matkin's comment on the reasons for McKenzie's disengagement, Matkin trivialized McKenzie's reasons for disengagement; blamed the situation on McKenzie's naivete ofMOOCs; and pointed to McKenzie's lack of experience in dealing with large and diverse student populations. In actuality, The Regents lacked an understanding of Coursera's MOOC platform and the attendant complications that arose from "massive" and "open" online courses.
> - 73. Matkin's statements, meant to throw McKenzie under the proverbial bus, failed to mention steps McKenzie took to deal with the emerging problems with The Course.
> - 74. Moreover, The Regents made statements and/or inferences that McKenzie engaged in rank commercialism and violated University policy related to the sale of his textbook. 

McKenzie goes on to detail how just about everyone (students, colleagues, journalists, etc) fell for this:

> - 75. All of these statements were false and/or misleading and besmirched McKenzie's personal reputation and subjected him to public ridicule by portraying him as someone totally derelict in duty.
> - 76. Students in the MOOC and commentators in Internet forums called into question McKenzie's ethical and academic integrity for caving over his commitment to The Course on what they incorrectly believed based upon the false reports to be inconsequential reasons.
> - 77. Individuals falsely speculated that McKenzie disengaged only because he sold all of the textbooks he could and saw no reason to stick with The Course.
> - 78. Others, based upon Defendants' misrepresentations, concluded that McKenzie did not have the requisite integrity and professional ethics to hold to his commitment to The Course and his students.

For concrete examples, see for instance [this trade publication](http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/professor-leaves-a-mooc-in-mid-course-in-dispute-over-teaching/42381) or [this](https://gigaom.com/2013/02/19/more-growing-pains-for-coursera-in-another-slip-up-professor-drops-out-mid-course/). 

McKenzie goes on to defend his character, and detail the emotional consequences this incident had on him. 

> - 79. Contrary to statements and inferences made by The Regents and Coursera, McKenzie's disengagement was not of his own volition, nor was it the result of him lacking the requisite professional ethics and integrity to honor his commitments, as some commentators and students, incorrectly deduced from the derogatory statements made by The Regents and Coursera.
> - 80. On the contrary, in McKenzie's attempts to press students to work diligently in The Course, he sought to uphold the highest of academic and professional standards for ethics and integrity. It was only when he was bullied, publicly ridiculed and harassed for his efforts, that he felt no option but to disengage from The Course.
> - 81. As a result of Defendants' conduct, McKenzie has suffered significant damage to his property, business, trade, profession and occupation. In addition, his reputation has suffered significant harm. Moreover, McKenzie has sustained significant emotional injuries in the form of shame, mortification and hurt feelings. 

McKenzie then details various interferences by Coursera and Matkin into the content of his course. This led to his disengagement, and a loss of rights on the platform. 

> - 89. As set forth above, The Regents forced McKenzie to disengage after he pressed unengaged students to become engaged and advised students that he would not concede his academic standards in The Course to accommodate unengaged students who were not completing assignments.
> - 90. Within two hours of advising The Regents that its conduct left him no choice but to disengage, McKenzie was demoted on the platform- at Matkin's order - from the status of "professor" to "student." 
> - 91. As a result and in a further attempt to silence McKenzie, The Regents' actions precluded McKenzie from posting an explanation to students. 

Personal commentary on Coursera's tactics
=========================================

The following is an extract from the Chronicle article linked above:

> Daphne Koller, one of Coursera’s founders, said by e-mail that Mr. McKenzie had not been “removed” from his role and that Coursera officials had not been in contact with the professor in recent weeks—suggesting that whatever “disagreements” led to Mr. McKenzie’s resignation had occurred at Irvine.

McKenzie says he was demoted from "instructor" to "student". The quote above is very poor journalism. My speculation, based on [personal experience](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/08/massiveteaching-mystery-captivates-confuses), is that Koller said "McKenzie was not removed from the course" (technically true), but that the journalist messed it up with his own fabrication, adding "from his role". 

My situation also involved building a defamation campaign based on distorted facts irrelevant to the background issue (in my case, unethical experimentation by me or the involvement of unengaged students; in McKenzie's the sale of his textbook and involvement of unengaged students). In my situation this also led to a bandwagon, with significant reputational, professional and emotional consequences.

In McKenzie's case, Irvine seems like a more than willing partner to engage in the defamation (hence the conspiracy allegations). In mine I simply don't know enough, but suspect my university was strong armed into it and actually a much weaker party. I do know that Koller lied to some of my superiors, misquoted me, and cherry-picked quotes out of context.
